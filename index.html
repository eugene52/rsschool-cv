				<h2>About:</h2>
				<p>I'm trying to become a front-end developer in order to get both popular skills and broaden my
					horizons.
					I have experience in back-end development, but modern life requires more.</p>
				<p>I have no ability to learn quickly, but I go step by step. And what I have learned remains in my
					memory
					and it is systematized.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2>Experience:</h2>
				<p>I worked for several companies, but mostly this work was remote and as I said earlier, at back end
					part.
					I have a little experience in managing the development team, as well as experience in communicating
					with
					the customer and delivering releases.</p>
